    If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
    a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
      - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

    After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
    reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

NVim Guide:

  TODO: The very first thing you should do is to run the command `:Tutor` in Neovim.

    If you don't know what this means, type the following:
      - <escape key>
      - :
      - Tutor
      - <enter key>

    (If you already know how the Neovim basics, you can skip this step)


  Next, run AND READ `:help`.
    This will open up a help window with some basic information
    about reading, navigating and searching the builtin help documentation.

    This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
    with something. It's one of my favorite neovim features.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not sure exactly what you're looking for.

  I have left several `:help X` comments throughout the init.lua
    These are hints about where to find more information about the relevant settings,
    plugins or neovim features used in kickstart.

If you experience any errors while trying to install kickstart, run `:checkhealth` for more info

-- Set <space> as the leader key

require('Judokasarin.options')
require('Judokasarin.keymaps')

-- [[ Install `lazy.nvim` plugin manager ]]

-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins, you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
require('lazy').setup {
  { import = 'Judokasarin.plugins' },
  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
  'tpope/vim-sleuth', -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  { 'numToStr/Comment.nvim',       opts = {} },

  -- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
  -- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following lua:
  --    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
  --
  -- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
  { -- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
    'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
    opts = {
      signs = {
        add = { text = '+' },
        change = { text = '~' },
        delete = { text = '_' },
        topdelete = { text = 'â€¾' },
        changedelete = { text = '~' },
      },
    },
  },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VeryLazy'
  --
  -- which loads which-key after all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end

  {                     -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
    'folke/which-key.nvim',
    event = 'VeryLazy', -- Sets the loading event to 'VeryLazy'
    config = function() -- This is the function that runs, AFTER loading
      require('which-key').setup()

      -- Document existing key chains
      require('which-key').register {
        ['<leader>c'] = { name = '[C]ode', _ = 'which_key_ignore' },
        ['<leader>d'] = { name = '[D]ocument', _ = 'which_key_ignore' },
        ['<leader>r'] = { name = '[R]ename', _ = 'which_key_ignore' },
        ['<leader>s'] = { name = '[S]earch', _ = 'which_key_ignore' },
        ['<leader>w'] = { name = '[W]orkspace', _ = 'which_key_ignore' },
      }
    end,
  },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin


  -- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments
  { 'folke/todo-comments.nvim', dependencies = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }, opts = { signs = false } },


  -- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
  -- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
  -- put them in the right spots if you want.

  -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for kickstart
  --
  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
  --
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
  require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',


}

-- The line beneath this is called `modeline`. See `:help modeline`
-- vim: ts=2 sts=2 sw=2 et
