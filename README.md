# 2pac's `nvim` config

This config is a fork of the `kickstart.nvim` project, and you can refer
to the forked documentation in the [`KICKSTART-README.md`](./KICKSTART-README.md) file.

## Install

Clone this repo in your OS default Neovim config location, and then run

```shell
nvim
```

that's it.
