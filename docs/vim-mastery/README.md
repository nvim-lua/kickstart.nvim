# 🎓 Vim Mastery - Progressive Learning Path

Master Vim one technique at a time, building real skill over months instead of trying to learn everything at once.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy: The One-Trick-Per-Week Method

Instead of overwhelming yourself with hundreds of commands:
1. **Learn ONE new command/technique each week**
2. **Practice it consciously** in your daily work
3. **Use it until it becomes muscle memory**
4. **Move to the next technique**

After one year: **52 new powerful techniques!**

## 📖 Weekly Structure

Each week follows this pattern:

### Monday: Learn
- Read the week's guide (15 minutes)
- Watch any linked videos
- Understand the concepts

### Tuesday-Friday: Practice
- Pick 2-3 commands from the week's list
- Use them consciously in real work
- Don't worry about speed yet
- Focus on correctness

### Weekend: Review
- What did you learn?
- What felt natural?
- What needs more practice?
- Pick next week's focus

---

## 💡 Learning Tips

### 1. Deliberate Practice
Don't just read - **use** the commands in real code.

### 2. Start Slow
Speed comes with muscle memory. Focus on correctness first.

### 3. One Thing at a Time
Master one command before adding another.

### 4. Keep a Cheat Sheet
Write down your current week's commands somewhere visible.

### 5. Use the In-Editor Cheatsheet
`<Leader>sc` is your friend!

### 6. Don't Rush
It's okay to spend 2 weeks on one topic if needed.

### 7. Apply Immediately
Learn Monday, use in real work Tuesday.

### 8. Embrace Mistakes
Undo (`u`) is your safety net. Experiment!
